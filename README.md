# The Internet And Web Page Design CSS Review Assignment
This assignment tests whether you can identify if a CSS file fails to load and what the error in that CSS file was. For this assignment, the red.css file's error is that it tries to change the text color for the entire HTML file rather than specifying an element to style. To fix this, either remove the "color:white" line from the CSS file or add it to the changes to the body elements style. If you're adding it to the body element's style changes, you can change it to look like this: "body { background-color:red ; color:white}".
